    <h1>Refunds & Terms</h1>
    <p class="muted"><b>Last updated:</b> January 14, 2026</p>

    <h2>1) Product</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Caffeine Tracker Unlock</b> is a one-time digital purchase that unlocks premium functionality
      in the Caffeine Tracker Garmin Connect IQ app (“App”).
    </p>

    <h2>2) How delivery works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You purchase via Stripe Checkout / Payment Link.</li>
      <li>During checkout, you provide your <b>App Code</b>.</li>
      <li>After successful payment, we send you an <b>unlock code</b> by email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) App Code responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      The unlock code is generated based on the <b>App Code</b> you provide. Please double-check it during checkout.
      If you entered a wrong App Code, contact support — we will typically be able to re-issue the unlock
      for the correct App Code after verifying the purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Refund policy</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <p>
        <b>In general:</b> If your unlock code was delivered and works for the App Code you provided,
        refunds are typically not offered (digital good).
      </p>
      <p><b>However, we will refund in reasonable cases, for example:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duplicate purchase (you paid twice by mistake)</li>
        <li>Technical issue on our side that prevents unlocking and we cannot fix it within a reasonable time</li>
        <li>Payment was successful but unlock code was not delivered and we cannot resolve delivery</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you need help or want to request a refund, contact:
      <a href="mailto:support@caffeinetracker.app">support@caffeinetracker.app</a> and include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the email used for purchase</li>
      <li>your Stripe receipt / transaction reference (if available)</li>
      <li>your App Code (and the correct one if you mistyped it)</li>
      <li>a short description of the issue</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) EU/EEA consumer notice (digital content)</h2>
    <p>
      By purchasing the Unlock, you request immediate delivery of digital content (the unlock code).
      Once the unlock code is delivered, you acknowledge that, depending on your jurisdiction, you may lose
      the right to withdraw from the contract for digital content that has been supplied with your prior express request.
    </p>

    <h2>6) No medical advice</h2>
    <p>
      The App provides informational estimates of caffeine levels and is not medical advice.
      You are responsible for your own health decisions. If you have medical concerns, consult a professional.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Availability & changes</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to keep the App and unlock flow available but do not guarantee uninterrupted operation.
      We may update the App, change features, or adjust pricing over time.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      The App and the Unlock are provided “as is”, without warranties of any kind.
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App or the Unlock.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Support</h2>
    <p>
      We provide best-effort support. Please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@caffeinetracker.app">support@caffeinetracker.app</a>
    </p>

    <h2>10) Marketing emails (optional)</h2>
    <p>
      If you explicitly opt in during checkout, we may send occasional product updates or tips by email.
      You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in the email or by contacting support.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and applicable EU law.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
