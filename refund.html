      <p class="muted"><b>Last updated:</b> January 2, 2026</p>

      <h2>Product</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Caffeine Tracker Unlock</b> is a one-time purchase that unlocks premium functionality in the Caffeine Tracker Garmin Connect IQ app.
      </p>

      <h2>How delivery works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You purchase via Stripe Checkout / Payment Link.</li>
        <li>During checkout, you provide your <b>App Code</b>.</li>
        <li>After successful payment, we send you an <b>unlock code</b> by email.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Refund policy</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><b>In general:</b> If your unlock code was delivered and works for the App Code you provided, refunds are typically not offered (digital good).</p>
        <p><b>However, we will refund in reasonable cases, for example:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Duplicate purchase (you paid twice by mistake)</li>
          <li>Technical issue on our side that prevents unlocking and we cannot fix it within a reasonable time</li>
          <li>You entered a wrong App Code and we cannot re-issue due to technical constraints (rare; usually we can re-issue)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        The App and unlock are provided “as is”.
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect,
        incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the App or unlock.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and applicable EU law.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need help or want to request a refund, email:
        <a href="mailto:support@caffeinetracker.app">support@caffeinetracker.app</a>
        and include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the email used for purchase</li>
        <li>your Stripe receipt / transaction reference (if available)</li>
        <li>your correct App Code</li>
        <li>a short description of the issue</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>EU/EEA consumer notice (digital content)</h2>
      <p>
        By purchasing the Unlock, you request immediate delivery of digital content (the unlock code).
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may lose the right to withdraw once digital delivery has started and the service has been performed.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        (If you want stricter legal wording for EU digital content withdrawal, tell me and I’ll give you a more explicit clause.)
      </p>

      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>
        We provide best-effort support. Please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@caffeinetracker.app">support@caffeinetracker.app</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App provides informational estimates of caffeine levels and is not medical advice.
        You are responsible for your own health decisions. If you have medical concerns, consult a professional.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
